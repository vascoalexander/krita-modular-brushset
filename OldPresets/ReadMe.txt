There are maybe some older presets that are still usefull for some people, but in general in cannot
recommend their usage. V4 has a lot of small improvements to nearly any preset that was also included in
the older Versions.

IMPORTANT!

There is no guarantee that the old presets work. If you install the old presets together with V4 things may
mess up and presets, old or new may not be loaded. All presets contained in this package have unique brushnames.
V4 and V3 brushnames are partly identical what might cause problems.

Brushes

In V4 are not all Brushes included that you need for the old versions. The Folder Deleted_Brushes contains
this brushes. The Folder Brushes_All_Versions contains brushes that are still included in V4, but also
are needed for the old presets.
