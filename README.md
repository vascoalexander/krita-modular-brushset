# Modular Brushset V4

![Modular Brushset V4 Cover](https://github.com/vascoalexander/krita-modular-brushset/blob/master/cover.png?raw=true 'Modular Brushset V4')

Created for Krita 2.8

## Introduction

More than the previous versions of this set, this is the collection of tools, I personally prefer and tweaked to my own needs, and not what i considered to be needed in general. That is why it is not something one may call complete and it was never meant as an replacement for the tools that ship with Krita.

One thing i believe in is that higher specialized tools reduce creative processes. On the other hand the spectrum of possible tools in traditional Art creation, is as wide as the imagination can go – endless. Hence that, we must find a balance, giving **the best tools to bring imagination to the canvas**, without limiting creativity by a dictation of the Tools we use. V4 of my Brushset is the version, that comes closest to this, from my own viewpoint.

### Digital and Traditional

The two main categories in this Set are “Digital” and “Traditional”, where traditional is meant as simulation of traditional art tools. When starting a new painting, i am asking myself what i need to accomplish my vision and I tend to think in this two dimensions.

**The Changes in Short:**

- The “Tools” and the “Types” Category are now integrated into 3 big ones
- Removed Presets with high similarity to the default ones
- Reduced the Number of highly specialized Presets
- Included “Krita Watercolor Set v1.0″
- Support for Tilt Sensitive Tablets (23 Presets)
- Completely reworked Brushpreviews
- Adjusted for Krita 2.8
- Improved Traditional Media Brushes
- Increased Amount of Autobrushes (giving more Flexibility)


### Naming, Prefixes and Sorting

I have used the same prefixes, to organize the Set, like in v3.0 with some small changes. In Krita 2.8 the possibilities to create tags and to use them for sorting are highly improved, compared to v 2.7. Honestly there is not really a need of prefixes to sort presets, but i stayed with this system, because it is simpler for me and there is no real reason not to do so. It also gives some advantages that are not possible without prefixes..

The advantage of the Prefixes and this kind of sorting is that **you can display any subcategory alone or in conjunction with any other (sub-)categories.** With the “Brushset-Sheet” (included in the download) you can easily figure out which code to type, to view a specific subcategory.

The whole Set is seperated in **3 Main Categories.** The choice is made by workflow and style differences. All categories as well as presetnames were chosen, with the idea that they are easy to remember and give a good “feeling”, what tools we have in our reach and in our mind…

The Filenames (.kpp preset files) are identical to the Brushnames with the difference that the spaces are replaced by underlines.

All Presets with purple Strokes are set to Dulling Mode with Color Rate activated. Blue Strokes indicate Smudge Presets without Color mixing and have additionally a drop for dulling or a swirl symbol for smearing in the top left corner.

**Some Terms that i use for preset-names in a more or less strictly way:**

Smeary = Smearing + Colorrate
Smudge = Smearing without Colorrate
Wet = Dulling + Colorrate
Blend = Dulling without Colorrate
Chalk = Textured Strokes

### Installation

Remove older Versions of the Modular Brushset before installing V4.
Copy the resource folders (brushes/paintoppresets) into your user directory of Krita.

The EXTRA folder contains Presets for showing categroy Numbers (1,2,3) and in case you downloaded the Standard Tilt-Sensor Version you additionally find Presets there, that are adjusted for Tablets without a Tilt Sensor (or for users that prefer not to use Tilt).

Default installation path of the Krita folder:

Linux: /home/username/.kde/share/apps/krita
Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.kde\share\apps
