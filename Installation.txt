Installation:
=============


1. Remove older Versions of the Modular Brushset before installing V4.
2. Copy the resource folders (brushes/paintoppresets) into your user directory of Krita.


The EXTRA folder contains Presets for showing categroy Numbers (1,2,3) and Presets, 
that are adjusted for Tablets without a Tilt Sensor (or for users that prefer not to use Tilt).


Default installation path of the Krita folder:
__________________________________________________________

Linux: /home/username/.kde/share/apps/krita
Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.kde\share\apps



Note: You should remove the older Versions before installing V4. 
Remember to cleanup old Files (Menü - Edit - Resources - Cleanup removed Files) 
and eventually clear the paintoppresets blacklist.
