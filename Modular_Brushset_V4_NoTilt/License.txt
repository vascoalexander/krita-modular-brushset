Brushes:

Some Brushes are taken from the "Essential Illustration Brushes V3 Exteneded" by Matthew M. Laskowski

"A NOTE ABOUT USAGE RIGHTS AND CREDITATION:
First, don't worry about it, and second, don't worry about it.
These brushes are just tools. They are not copyrighted or infringe-able. What you create with them becomes copyrighted only to yourself. This is wholly free. You do not need to credit me. You can feel free to link people to these brushes if you want, but don't feel obligated to credit me as the provider to make your work possible. I was not responsible, you and your skill is responsible.
Think of it this way: would you write a note to Utrect, Steadtler, Faber-Castell etc to ask if it's OK to use their line of pencils, pens, and markers to make your art? No, you wouldn't, and this brush set is no different. Have fun, and create!"
